This repository contains all files relevant to our paper "How do my distributions differ? Significance testing for the Overlapping Index using Permutation Test".

You can find the paper pre-print, the Rnw. file, and the simulated data on which we performed comparison between tests for power and type I error.

Feel free to get in touch for any suggestion or doubt.
